 <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Register for the Advanced Teen
Astronomy Camp<br>
June 23 - July 1, 2008</h2>

 <p>The Advanced Astronomy Camp is quantitative in its approach. Students are
required to have completed satisfactorily either Algebra II or Geometry in
school. Attendance at the Beginning Astronomy Camp is not necessary and does
not automatically qualify a student for the Advanced Camp. </p>

 <p>Students should be between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Some exceptions are
made in special circumstances by <a href="mailto:dmccarthy@as.arizona.edu">Dr.
McCarthy</a>, the Camp Director. </p>

 <p><b>Beginning in January 2008, qualified applicants will be accepted on a 
first-come, first-served basis</b> until the Camp is full. Admission is limited to 
26 students. <b>To be successful</b> applications must follow all the stated directions. 
Applications will be judged <b>competitively</b> 
based on the quality of their essays, ability to follow directions, and teacher recommendations. Prospective 
students <b>must contact</b> the Camp Director before applying. </p>

 <p>Entrance into the Advanced Camp is increasingly competitive. In 2007, the Camp was 
filled by the end of February and only 50% of all applications could be accommodated. 
We strongly urge students to adhere to the specific entrance
requirements, to follow directions exactly, and to do the best job possible 
on the essay. Although we want former students to reapply, preference will be
given to new students. <b>Former Advanced Campers</b> wishing to reapply must
write about a research project which could be accomplished using Camp equipment
and which could also involve other Campers. See the essay topics for more
information. </p>

 <p><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>PARENTS</span>:</b> Before applying, please
consider your child's transportation to and from Astronomy Camp. We prefer that
students arrive in Tucson on the first day (June 23) of Camp by 3 PM. On the
last day (July 1), we will be driving two hours from a remote mountain site to
Tucson, so students cannot depart on airline flights any earlier than 1:30 PM.
Limitations in airline schedules may make these arrangements difficult
depending on your location. Although we can accommodate a few students arriving
one day early and/or departing one day late, such arrangements are inconvenient
and will necessitate additional cost to you. Please email <a
href="mailto:dmccarthy@as.arizona.edu">Dr. McCarthy</a>, if you have travel
concerns and questions. </p> Also please note the following:
<ul>
<li>
The tuition fee of $950 includes all expenses during the Camp session such as room, board, materials, and local travel.

<li>
Travel arrangements must be confirmed with Dr. McCarthy no later than May
9.
<li>
Scholarship notification will made no later than April 4.
</ul>

<p><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>To APPLY</span>:</b> please mail the following six items in a <b>single</b> 
mailing to the address shown below. We will then send you follow-up information.
 <ul>

1.The completed <a href="atcform.pdf"><b>application form</b></a>;<br>

2. An essay of at least <b>1000 words</b> on one of three <a href="essay.html">topics</a>;<br> 

3. A <b>confidential, sealed</b> letter of recommendation from either a science or math teacher. 
In addition to describing the student's strengths, this letter should also address how the 
Astronomy Camp experience could benefit the student (e.g., socially, personally, academically, etc.);<br>

4. Your deposit in the amount of $250 (payable to <b>Astronomy Camp) unless you are a scholarship applicant</b>. 
[The full tuition is $950; $50 is a non-refundable handling fee.] <br>

5. The signed <a href="DISCLAIMER.pdf"><b>disclaimer form</b></a>.<br>

6. <a href="scholar.pdf"><b>Scholarship Application form</b></a> (if necessary). </p>
<p>


<p>The remainder of the $950 tuition fee must be received <b>no later than May
9</b>. Cancellation after this date will result in a forfeiture of 50% of the
tuition fee. </p>

<p>Mail the above five items <b>together</b> to: </p>

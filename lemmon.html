<font size +1><b>A</b></font>n aerial view of the summit of 
<A HREF="http://emol.org/tour/mtlemmon.html">Mt. Lemmon</A>. This 
<a href="http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r119.htm">"sky island"</a> is located approximately 45 miles north 
of the University of Arizona in the Coronado National Forest in the  Catalina mountains. In this view looking 
south towards Tucson, the 60-inch telescope is at the extreme bottom center and the 40-inch telescope is above 
it to the right of the road. The men's and women's dormitories are the long, darkish buildings near the top center. 
At the extreme right center is another 60-inch <a href="http://www.astro.umn.edu/~irlab/telescopes/mlof.html">telescope</a>
 operated by the University of Minnesota. In the building adjacent to that telescope dome, Astronomy Campers 
eat their meals and utilize a half-court gymnasium for lectures, 
demos, and recreation.

<font size +1><b>T</b></font>his 20-acre site has played a historic role in the 
<a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/airdef/searching_the_skies.htm">defense</a> 
of our country and in the <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2000.41510.x">development</a>
of infrared astronomy. It was formerly a Radar Base of the Air Defense Command and was 
converted into an observatory for infrared astronomy in October 1970. Until 2003, a geodesic dome near the left center of 
the aerial view housed the last of the radar tracking facilities which was operated by Ft. Huachuca. This station was 
also able to direct the Space Shuttle to an emergency landing in White Sands, New Mexico and was involved with
initial testing of cruise missile navigation. The square area at top 
right is a former communications center for the Titan  
missile defense system. Further information and interesting photos about the role of Mt. Lemmon and the Air Defense 
Command can be found in the <a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/bonnie/146509">Arizona Daily Star</a> and at 
<a href="http://www.radomes.org/">Air Defense Radar Veterans' Assoc.</a> (select "Radar Museum," then
"Radar Sites," and search for the location of "Lemmon.")

<p>
<font size +1><b>T</b></font>he summit area itself is Federal land and is maintained by the University for 
astronomical research and science education under the terms of a Permit with the U.S. Forest Service. The site 
operates on commercial electrical power with its own standby power plant. Water is obtained from several deep 
wells and stored in 500,000-gal. tanks (right center). A full-time supervisor resides at the site. Emergency 
medical personnel are based only three miles away and a helicopter landing area is available (left of geodesic dome) 
for emergencies. <p>

<font size +1><b>The 20-inch</b></font> Jamieson reflector (foreground) is a gift from the estate of Dr. John Jamieson
who helped pioneer the emerging field of infrared astronomy. The dome and related infrastructure were provided through
educational funds from the NSF Career Grant of Dr. Laird Close for use by the 
<a href ="http://zeus.as.arizona.edu/~dmccarthy/GSUSA/index.htm">Girl Scout Astronomy Camps</a>. This telescope features a German-equatorial
mount and produces exquisite images. It can be used simultaneously for both infrared and visible observations. This picture is
taken from the geodesic dome looking north. Other telescopes
are also visible including the 40-inch (left), the 60-inch (rear), and the  
<a href="http://lemmon.kasi.re.kr/">1.0 meter telescope</a> operated remotely from the <a href="http://www.kao.re.kr/html/english/">
Korean Astronomy Observatory</a>. The 12-inch telescope is behind the Korean facility.

<font size +1><b>The 40-inch</b></font> Cassegrain reflector. The f/16 optical design of this telescope features 
an inverted Dall-Kirkham (Pressman-Camichel) arrangement with a single-arch spherical primary mirror (f/2) and 
oblate ellipsoid secondary. Equipped with relative encoders on a German equatorial mount, the 40-inch has a fast 
speed, motorized slew motion in right ascension but is hand-slewn in declination. Astronomy Campers learn 
the principles of telescopic observation here and conduct research projects by eyepiece, CCD imagers, and a CCD 
spectrograph in visible light. Many former Campers have developed and honed their observational skills with this telescope. After 
several summers of research projects, former Camper Nathan Robins has written a poetic <A HREF="Ode.htm">"Ode to Age"</A> 
describing his experiences and fondness for the Forty-Inch telescope.

<p>
<font size +1><b>I</b></font>n the foreground of this picture is an automatically observing 10-inch f/10 
telescope operated by the <a href="http://tmf-web.jpl.nasa.gov/projects.html">Optical Communications Group</a> 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for 
"atmospheric visibility monitoring" measurements. Three AVM systems are located throughout the Southwest. They
operate autonomously  to collect data on stellar intensities in conjunction with weather information. The goal
is to determine experimentally the statistics of atmospheric transmission in order to assess the suitability of optical
communication with deep space probes. Articles describing this facility were published in <em>Laser Focus World</em> 
(June 1998, pp. 139-141) and in the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997SPIE.2990..114J&amp;db_key=AST">SPIE</a> (1997).

<font size +1><b>The 60-inch</b></font> Cassegrain reflector. It incorporates a parabolic primary mirror
(f/2) with interchangeable secondaries to achieve Cassegrain focal ratios of either f/16 or f/45. The telescope
can also be used at prime focus where a CCD-mosaic camera which captures images of a one degree 
wide field-of-view down to magnitude 22. This camera is used routinely by the <a href="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/css_facilities.html">
Catalina Sky Survey</a> to discover and monitor near-earth asteroids and minor planets in the solar system. The 
latter is used for infrared  observations. The telescope has a motorized equatorial mount 
equipped  accurate encoders for positioning  on the sky.  An adjacent warm room is used by Astronomy Campers to 
analyze their data by computer image processing and to plan the details of their observations. 
Click <a href="http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/60inch/#mark2">here </a> for more information about the 60-inch telescope.<p>

<font size +1><b>B</b></font>oth the 40 and 60-inch telescopes were developed "in-house" at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory's 
optics shop by optician Mr. Robbie Wayland. They are described in his book "Optics of the Cassegrain."

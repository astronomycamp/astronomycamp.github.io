<font><b>U</b></font>sing the 2048x2048 CCD at the 61" telescope,
teen campers measured the expansion rate of the Universe,
<I>i.e.</I>, the Hubble Constant, during the June 1996 Advanced Teen 
Astronomy Camp.

<p>
<font><b>A</b></font> research team, led by Elizabeth Waterhouse, obtained 
CCD images of the brightest elliptical galaxies in galaxy clusters. By
measuring the apparent diameters and brightnesses of these galaxies, the 
team derived a Hubble Constant of 61.5 km/s/Mpc.

<p>

<font><b>I</b></font>n Spring 1997, Elizabeth Waterhouse won second place in the <A HREF="http://www.astroleague.org/al/awards/nyaa/noya00wn.html">National Young Astronomer Award</A> sponsored by the Astronomical League. Her project
was entitled <em>"Determination of the 
Hubble Constant Through Magnitude Analysis of Elliptical Galaxies"</em>. 
You can read the abstract and first page of her <A HREF="hubb1.jpg">research paper</A>. <BR>

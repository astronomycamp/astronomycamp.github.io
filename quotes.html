<strong><I>"We don't just look at stars, we observe them."</I></strong><br>(Advanced Teen Camper, 2018)
<p>
<strong><I>"This year we are both freshmen at Barnard College in New York City. Although we never met during Camp, over the past summer 
we discovered our shared experience at Kitt Peak, and have since become friends.... Astronomy Camp has not only been a source of joy in our 
lives (we share Camp stories all the time!), but has inspired us to reach for the stars."</I></strong><br> (two former Campers from 2017)
<p>
<strong><I>"We have one woman who said this was her survival course because her husband is an amateur astronomer and she wanted to learn more about it."
</I></strong><br> (Adult Camp 1990) Tucson Citizen Sep 27, 1990
<p>
<strong><I>"You guys are encouraging us to think and explore vs memorize and regurgitate." </I></strong><br>
(GSUSA Camp #1)
<p>
<strong><I>"I guess it's a good time to leave; if it weren't, it would mean that we hadn't thoroughly enjoyed our time there.... I think 
it's pretty safe to say that I would not be who or where I am today without Camp.... I guess what I'm trying to say is that Camp has been the 
best and most memorable and valuable time of my life. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity."</I></strong><br> (Advanced Camper 2004)
<p>
<strong><I>"There's only three days left at Camp and no one at home understands me."</I></strong><br> (Advanced Camper in tears, ATC 2011)
<p>
<strong><I>"This camp even sparked my interest in astronomy so much, that I am even considering it as a career along with dermatology." </I></strong><br>
(Beginning Teen Camper 2005; later attended two Advanced Camps; became a staff member; and received her PhD in astronomy from Caltech) 
<p>
<strong><I>“I have never seen math and science used together.” </I></strong><br> (Honor’s student – middle school) - Camper
<p>
<strong><I>"I know he had a good time and learned a lot, every once in a while he'll just spout out some fact he learned, 
or say 'Did you know ....' "</I></strong><br> (parent of Beginning Teen Camper, 2005)
<p>
<strong><I>"THANK YOU ... THANK YOU ... THANK YOU.. for making such a profound difference in our son's life. From the time we picked him 
up at O'Hare airport until we got home (four hours later) he never once stopped talking about his tales from astronomy camp. ... 
HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. In his words as we picked him up at the airport, "It was the best 'vacation' I ever had!!" </I></strong><br> (parent of Beginning Teen Camper, 2001)
<p>
<strong><I>"He greeted his father at the airport with, 'that was the most fun I have ever done, but I am wiped out!' Patrick slept for 14 
hours the first day back! He plans to reapply next year for the advanced camp and I am sure that by December we will have heard most of his stories, 
adventures and educational experiences he enjoyed." </I></strong><br>(parent of Beginning Teen Camper, 2001)
<p>
<strong><I>"One of the first things I asked him when I picked him up at the airport in Chicago was, 'Did you learn a lot?' 
He replied, 'Not really,' but then spent the next hour and a half telling me all he had learned." </I></strong><br> (parent, 2003)
<p>
<strong><I>"The recently completed "Astronomy Camp" on Mt. Lemmon, Bigelow, and Kitt Peak was a very high point in my 72 year 
old life."</I></strong><br> (Adult Camper, May 1992)
<p>
<strong><I>"Unfortunately Jeff Bezos will be unable to attend Astronomy Camp in April. He looks forward to 
participating sometime in the future, but is unable to commit to a new date at this time. Thank you for your help. I look 
forward to working with you in the future."</I></strong><br> Executive Assistant to Jeff Bezos, Travel Coordinator (Jan 16, 2003)
<p>
<strong><I>"I know firsthand about the positive impact the camp has had on (my son's) young life. His first year came at such an critical 
period of his life. ... As it turned out, Astronomy Camp was the turning point in (his) life. He made so many lifelong friends 
and I am so proud of his accomplishments! As a result of his positive experience at your astronomy camp, 
(he) set himself a goal his Sophomore year of high school and with a few adjustments along the way, 
achieved his goal to procure a pilot seat in the Air Force via University of Arizona’s ROTC. ... Thank you so much!"</I></strong> 
<br>(parent of a Beginning & Advanced Camper, 2002-2005)
<p>
<strong><I>"I simply can't thank you enough for the opportunity you gave my son, Alex ..., this past week.  
Alex has been talking non-stop about everything he did, and learned, and he was positively heartbroken last night that it only lasted 8 days.  
We're probably going to drive up to Kitt Peak today because he wants me to see where he's been.  It was such an exceptional thing to be able to 
do at this age. THANK YOU!!!  ... I'm stunned by how much has been injected into Alex's 
brain in so short a period of time.  Please extend my warmest thanks to everyone on your staff.  You really run an amazing program. Very best wishes."
 </I></strong><br> (parent of Advanced Teen Camper, June, 2012)

"Oh how I miss naked-eye views of the MIlky Way! In my three years at Astronomy Camp, I've learned so much and leave with increasing desire to go back. It's really
a magical experience - the late nights and moths are just part of it."<br>

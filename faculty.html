<P>
Dr. Don McCarthy, Director of Astronomy
Camp, is an Astronomer and Lecturer at Steward Observatory of The University of Arizona. His research specialities
center on infrared astronomy, techniques for removing atmospheric blurring (interferometry and adaptive optics), 
and direct imaging searches for planets around other stars. He also leads the Education and Public Outreach program
for the University's Near-Infrared Camera project for the future James Webb Space Telescope. He has directed the Astronomy
Camps for 19 years. 
<P>

Dr. McCarthy and his colleagues at Steward Observatory provide hands-on activities and lectures on
topics ranging from the Solar System to Cosmology. Guest speakers come
from such prestigious institutions as the National Optical Astronomy
Observatories, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the
Planetary Science Institute. They provide a diversity of expertise
from celestial mechanics and space missions to theoretical
physics. 

<P>
Undergraduate and graduate astronomy students serve as camp
counselors. Many of these students are former Campers and come from other Universities.
 Dr. McCarthy and the counselors
are with the campers full-time.

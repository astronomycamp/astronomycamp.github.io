This year marks the <strong><u>37th anniversary</u></strong> of the Beginning Camp! These camps provide a genuinely unique educational experience, unlike anything else in the United States. We encourage all students with a particular interest in math, science, optics, engineering, or astronomy to apply. These camps are focused on &quot;hands-on&quot; projects that are challenging and fun, we also include leisure time for recreational activities, but <em><strong>first and foremost these camps are designed as academic adventures</em></strong>.            <br/>            <br/>            <strong>Astronomy Camp engages students</strong> through the concept of <em><strong>doing</strong></em> science and engineering. It is an <strong>immersion experience</strong> that reinforces school subjects and demonstrates future career areas. Students develop scientific skills of experimentation and data collection using some of the many research facilities which have given Tucson the title &quot;<strong>Astronomy Capital of the World</strong>.&quot; Interactive talks on scientific topics of current interest are also presented. This program is combined with a number of other fun activities relating to the unique environment of the Southwestern and <a href="https://www.desertusa.com/sonoran-desert.html">Sonoran Deserts</a>.            <br/>            <br/>            <strong>Steward Observatory</strong> astronomer Donald W. McCarthy is the <a href="faculty.html">Camp Director</a>. Serving as <a href="CampCounselors.html">camp counselors and teaching assistants</a> are astronomy graduate and undergraduate students who guide the campers through the adventure that real &quot;hands-on&quot; science has to offer. The counseling staff uses a very &quot;Youth Centered&quot; approach and treat the campers as colleagues, encouraging them to ask questions and help them find the answers to those that have puzzled them. The Director and counselors are with the students <strong>full time</strong> throughout the week. Other guest lecturers include astronomers, engineers, and space artists from other universities, NASA facilities, and research teams from around the United States.            <br/>            <br/>            <strong>Tuition</strong> ($1700 for Beginning Camp; $1900 for Advanced Camp) includes lodging, meals, transportation in Tucson, and all materials. Partial tuition scholarships are available and based on financial need. These scholarships come from former campers (teen and adult), the Richard F. Caris Foundation, and from the <a href="http://www.dudleyobservatory.org/">Dudley Observatory</a> in Schenectady, New York.            <br/>            <br/>  	  </div>          <!-- STOP MAIN BAR -->          <!-- START CONTENT HEADER -->          <!-- HEADER: teencamps -->	  <div id="main_header_full" class="extra_space">Beginning Camp</div>	  <!-- STOP CONTENT HEADER --><!-- START MAIN BAR -->          <!-- MAIN: teencamps-->  	  <div class="main_full camp">            <strong>BEGINNING CAMP</strong> - (Offered for students late-12 through 15 years old). This Camp is for students who have a strong interest in <em>science, astronomy, and engineering</em>. Upon arrival, students travel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lemmon_Observatory">Mt. Lemmon Observatory</a> about 1.5 hours drive southwest of Tucson. Once on the summit (9200 feet), they immediately become real astronomers doing hands-on projects at many different telescopes. The Campers control the 8-inch and 11-inch HyperStar, 12-inch LX-200, <a href="http://www.as.arizona.edu/schulman-telescope">24, and 32-inch</a> telescopes, etc., pointing them to many interesting deep-sky objects and analyzing astronomical objects over six nights. Observing projects include astronomical imaging, spectroscopy, electronic photometry, digital imaging and astrophotography, experiments in basic physics, computer simulations and developing skills in navigation by the Sun, moon and star constellations. On one night the Campers use the historic 61-inch <a href="http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/61inch/">Kuiper</a> telescope. We also conduct daytime experiments in solar observing.            <br/>            <br/>            <strong>During daytime hours</strong>, Astronomy Camp students undertake a variety of hands-on projects in science and engineering. Some examples of projects are measuring solar activity, interacting with professional astronomers on modern research topics, hiking a scale model of our Solar System in the unique environment of Mt. Lemmon, playing volleyball, and even eating ice cream &quot;from Saturn&quot; cooled by liquid nitrogen. There are also other hikes around the area to introduce basic concepts of ecology, geology, and orienteering.  Typically, we also take a day trip into Tucson to visit the campus of <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/">The University of Arizona</a>, the <a href="http://www.pimaair.org/">Pima Air and Space Museum</a> and the University's <a href= "https://mirrorlab.arizona.edu/">Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab</a>.            <br/>            <br/>            <strong>Students sleep</strong> in the astronomers' dormitories along with the adult counselors and the Director. Responsibility and teamwork are vital parts of the Camp experience. Students and adult leaders also work together in teams to prepare meals, clean the facilities, and to compete against other teams in some of the many science projects.            <br/>            <br/>            <strong>Here is a</strong> sample schedule from the <a href="../docs/BTC2022_Schedule.pdf">2022 Beginning Teen Camp</a> which was held on Mt.

Students reside at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lemmon_Observatory">Mt. Lemmon Observatory</a> for six nights and seven days to allow maximum time on the telescopes. Students form and complete one or more research projects to present to the entire camp on the last night of camp. Research activities include digital imaging, spectroscopy, electronic photometry, and astrophotography for studies involving variable stars, spectral classification, asteroid orbit determination, etc. An overnight trip to the world's largest telescope, the<a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/large-binocular-telescope">Large Binocular Telescope</a>, is an annual highlight. We utilize the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) of the <a href="http://aro.as.arizona.edu/">Arizona Radio Observatory</a>, the 24- and 32-inch telescopes on Mt.

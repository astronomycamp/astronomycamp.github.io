            Admission to the Advanced Astronomy Camp requires an essay of at least 1200 words. This essay is our primary means of gauging a student's motivation, creativity, maturity, and ability to follow directions. These are qualities we value highly in our Advanced Camp students and we feel they are valuable to future success. The essay must combine both fact and imagination. Students should first research existing knowledge about the topic and use that research as a basis for imaginative extrapolation. The factual basis must cite at least three published references not including Internet sites. The essay must start with an imaginative title. We include some sample references to help you incorporate current understanding.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To help prospective campers gauge the level of competition, we provide two essays from students who attended the 2000 Advanced Camp: &quot;<a href="../../../articles/johnston_essay.html">The Slumber of the Suns</a>&quot; (Cheryl Johnston) and &quot;<a href="../../../articles/rapoport_essay.html">The Legacy of Copernicus</a>&quot; (Ezra Rapoport).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            New students must write on one of the following three topics. Previous Advanced Campers wishing to reapply must write about a proposed research project that might also interest other Advanced Campers. See below for a more detailed description.

            <strong><u>Essay #1</u>:</strong> More than 1500 planets have been discovered orbiting other stars. You are responsible for choosing one of THESE planets or its hypothetical moon(s) to colonize. Where would you go and what would you hope to learn there? Base your essay on known properties of the parent star(s) and the planets themselves.

            <strong><u>Essay #2</u>:</strong> You visit a hypothetical planet in a KNOWN binary star system of your choice. Describe how and why life on your planet would be different from that on Earth. Base your essay on the known properties of the parent stars (e.g., mass, temperature, luminosity, orbit, lifetime, age, etc.).

            We encourage previous advanced campers to reapply for the Advanced Camp in year 2015. Since many qualified students are expected to apply for the first time, it is likely that no more than two repeating campers can be admitted. Each year's Advanced Camp has a different theme for daily activities, but the main focus at night will still be the research projects conducted by teams of students using the equipment in our collection.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Students wishing to reapply must write an observing proposal, similar to, but more detailed than, the proposals they wrote during a previous Advanced Camp. Based on your experience with our instruments, you should be able to describe a new project which you and other students could conduct together during the one week camp. This summer we plan to use the 12-meter and SMT radio telescopes of the <a href="http://aro.as.arizona.edu/">Arizona Radio Observatory</a>, the 16- and 20-inch telescopes of the <a href="http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/">Advanced Observing Program</a> on Kitt Peak, the <a href="http://www.noao.edu/0.9m/">WIYN 0.9-meter</a> telescope with its <a href="http://www.noao.edu/kpno/mosaic/">'Mosaic' CCD</a>, and possibly the Steward Observatory <a href="http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/90inch/90inch.html">90-inch</a> telescope using Dr. McCarthy's infrared camera <a href="https://www.mmto.org/node/64">PISCES</a>. Please feel free to ask us for information about the telescopes and for guidance in general. To be successful, you do not have to solve any modern mysteries of the Universe, just propose something which interests you, utilizes our equipment, and would interest other students. Your project may be a challenging one but it must be realistic. You must include the following in your proposal:
            
            <ol>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Abstract</li>
              <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>A concise paragraph summarizing your goals.</li>

              <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Why is this project interesting and what do you hope to learn from the observations?</li>
                <li>Be sure to list some published references to provide scientific context for your proposal and cite any articles etc. you have used in preparing your proposal.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Scientific Method</li>
              <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>How will you obtain and analyze your data? </li>
                <li>What telescopes and instruments do you require? </li>
                <li>How much observing time is necessary?</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Team Management</li>
              <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">As the leader of your project: 
                <li>How will you involve other students in the observing, analysis, and presentation aspects of this project? </li>
                <li>How will you deal with the fact that these students may not understand anything about your topic but are eager to learn and participate? </li>
                <li>How will you interact with your colleagues to encourage, teach, and manage them during the week-long camp?</li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
